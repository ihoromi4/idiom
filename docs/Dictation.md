# Introduction
A **dictation** is a language learning approach where the student listens to spoken text in target language, transcribe and write it down word for word \[[[Dictation#^d14d30|2]]\].

A dictation can be used to develop skills:
- Listening comprehension;
- Spelling;
- Grammar;
- Punctuation.

# Types of dictation
Four types of dictation that can be used for language learning \[[[Dictation#^5b0bf1|1]]\] :
1. Phonemic item dictation
2. Phonemic text dictation
3. Orthographic item dictation
4. Orthographic text dictation

The **phonemic item dictation** is a method when the teacher presents the individual sounds of a language to the student for transcription. This method is useful to increase the students' ability to recognize the sounds of a language and their contrasts. This method is preferable way to teach beginners to recognize the sound system of English.

The **phonemic text dictation** is an extension of the *phonemic item dictation* method. In this method the teacher should recite a passage which the student phonetically transcribe. This method is useful to develop understanding the way English sounds change in connected speech. This method doesn't meet the objectives set for students in most education programs of native English countries.

The **orthographic item dictation** is a method when the teacher dictate individual words in isolation for transcription. It is similar to the traditional spelling test. This method may help reinforce the correlation between the spelling system and sound system of a language.

The **orthographic text dictation** is a method that assumes transcription of a unified passage. This is the classic dictation exercise all foreign language teachers are familiar with. This method uncovers comprehension and grammatical weaknesses in learner which the teacher can analyze and address in future lessons.
